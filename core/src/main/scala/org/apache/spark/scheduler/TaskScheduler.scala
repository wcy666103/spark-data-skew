/**
 * Low-level task scheduler interface, currently implemented exclusively by
 * [[org.apache.spark.scheduler.TaskSchedulerImpl]].
 * This interface allows plugging in different task schedulers. Each TaskScheduler schedules tasks
 * for a single SparkContext. These schedulers get sets of tasks submitted to them from the
 * DAGScheduler for each stage, and are responsible for sending the tasks to the cluster, running
 * them, retrying if there are failures, and mitigating stragglers. They return events to the
 * DAGScheduler.
